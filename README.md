# EDA and Feature Engineering - Zomato Dataset
Welcome to the EDA and Feature Engineering - Zomato Dataset repository! Here, you will find a collection of Jupyter Notebooks, Tableau Dashboard PNGs and other files related to the Zomato dataset. The notebooks include exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model building. The Tableau Dashboard PNGs provide visual representation of the dataset. The repository is regularly updated with new examples and explanations to help you learn and understand how to perform EDA, feature engineering, and model building using the Zomato dataset.

## Getting Started
To get started, simply clone or download the repository to your local machine. The repository contains Jupyter notebooks and Tableau Dashboard PNGs that demonstrate different concepts related to EDA, feature engineering, and model building.

## How to use
To run the Jupyter notebooks, make sure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your machine. You can then open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook and run it. Each notebook contains comments that explain what the code is doing, so be sure to read through them. To view the Tableau Dashboard PNGs, you will need a image viewer.
